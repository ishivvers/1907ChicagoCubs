## Outline: ##

- datalib.py
 - a library of generally-useful functions
- exploration.py
 - a set of scripts used for initial exploration of the data (in functional form)
- models.py
 - actual implementations of models


------------------------------------------------
## to do: ##

- Feature exploration 
- better to normalize/recenter/etc?
- time-based?
  - averaged over last few hours, plus over day, plus derivatives?
   - For now, just doing daily averages of today, yesterday, tomorrow; Assuming that change is happening on day+ timescales
 - different directions? I.E. East, North, West, South local averages. (maybe 2 distances) ((I think this is already covered by using all GEFs points.)
- Run feature selection on a randomized subset of data
- Run a SVM on selected features
- Run a gridsearch for SVM parameters on a randomized subset of data
