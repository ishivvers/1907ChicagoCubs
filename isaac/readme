## Outline: ##

- datalib.py
 - a library of generally-useful functions
- exploration.py
 - a set of scripts used for initial exploration of the data (in functional form)
- models.py
 - actual implementations of models


------------------------------------------------
## to do: ##

- implement a complete model that's simply interpolation
- write a function that provides a uniform metric for each model, based on some sort of k-fold CV. Probably just a wrapper around sklearn functions
- better features
 - use sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV for feature selection
 - time-based?
  - averaged over last few hours, plus over day, plus derivatives?
 - local position-weighted averages, instead of all data
 - different directions? I.E. East, North, West, South local averages. (maybe 2 distances)
