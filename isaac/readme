## Outline: ##

- datalib.py
 - a library of generally-useful functions
- exploration.py
 - a set of scripts used for initial exploration of the data (in functional form)
- models.py
 - actual implementations of models


------------------------------------------------
## to do: ##

- I think the best solution is to use the features I have here and go for it
 - use some number of nearest GEFs points for each mesonet location
 - build a model for each mesonet site (easy parallel-wise)
  - run a 5-fold CV search for best parameters on random 10% of the train data
  - use those parameters to fit a model to all of the data
  - use that model to predict the output
  - repeat for N different model types
- need to:
 - write functions that take in a trainX, trainY, testY and return a predictY for each model type
 - write a parallel wrapper that takes each of those and applies them to all 98 mesonet sites
