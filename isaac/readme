## Outline: ##

- datalib.py
 - a library of generally-useful functions
- exploration.py
 - a set of scripts used for initial exploration of the data (in functional form)


------------------------------------------------
## to do: ##

- get anaconda on anathem
- write a function that provides a uniform metric for each model, based on some sort of k-fold CV. Probably just a wrapper around sklearn functions
- use Ridge, lasso, or ElasticNet without any interpolation
	- try to use Ridge with a single alpha, similar to the starter_code example
	 - does it average/sum/... daily/modeled values?
	- use RidgeCV to choose an alpha
	- use sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV for feature selection
	- see if this makes sense, is informative
- better features
 - time-based?
  - averaged over last few hours, plus over day, plus derivatives?
  - can we use time from the future? (the next day's 00:00 prediction includes new observations)
 - local position-weighted averages, instead of all data
