## Outline: ##

- datalib.py
 - a library of generally-useful functions
- exploration.py
 - a set of scripts used for initial exploration of the data (in functional form)
- models.py
 - actual implementations of models

## to do: ##

- Feature exploration
- time-based?
  - averaged over last few hours, plus over day, plus derivatives?
   - For now, just doing daily averages of today, yesterday, tomorrow; Assuming that change is happening on day+ timescales
 - different directions? I.E. East, North, West, South local averages. (maybe 2 distances)
  - Could have each sample at each point be a bit of data about it, and look for a model for all points
   - I think there are some points that are relatively shitty, this works less well for those, but could
     still be worth submitting as a trial
   - I also think that including (most of) the GEFs grid is helpful because some stations may be more correlated
     with each other because of Altitude or other topographic reasons, rather than absolute location.
- Run a SVM on selected features
- Run a gridsearch for SVM parameters on a randomized subset of data
