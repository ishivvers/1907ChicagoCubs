### sketch ###

- We submitted the models as built by the script <code>isaac/final_models.py</code>.
- Each submission consisted of predictions from one model built for each MESONET point, based on features calculated for the nearest 9 GEFS gridpoints.
- We did ok; at least we beat all of the benchmarks!
